Question: What symptoms should prompt a call to the pediatrician if an infant is vomiting?
Answer: Symptoms that should prompt a call to the pediatrician include green-colored vomit, projectile vomiting, decreased urination (dry diapers for over 6 hours), fever of 101 Fahrenheit for over 3 days, or signs of dehydration like no tears when crying, dry mouth, and cold extremities.
Question: When does the complete set of primary teeth typically fully emerge?
Answer: The complete set of primary teeth, totaling 20, typically fully emerges by the time a child is two to three years old.
Question: What are dental sealants and why are they used in children?
Answer: Dental sealants are protective coatings applied to the chewing surfaces of a child's molars to prevent decay by sealing out food and plaque. They are particularly beneficial for areas like pits and fissures in molars that are prone to accumulating food particles.
Question: What is Bisphenol A (BPA) and why is it a concern in dental sealants?
Answer: Bisphenol A (BPA) is a chemical used in making various plastics and resins, including some dental materials like sealants. Concerns arise because BPA can potentially seep into the body, possibly affecting brain function and behavior in children, as well as increasing blood pressure.
Question: How much BPA is released from dental sealants and is it safe?
Answer: Studies show that dental sealants release about 0.09 nanograms of BPA, which is significantly lower than the safety threshold of 1 million nanograms per day proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency for a 6-year-old child. The American Dental Association considers this amount safe.
Question: At what age can children receive dental sealants, and what does the procedure involve?
Answer: Children can get dental sealants as soon as their first molars appear, typically around age 6. The procedure is simple and painless: the dentist applies an acidic gel to clean the teeth, paints on the sealant, and then hardens it with a blue light.
Question: What are the proven benefits of dental sealants in children's oral health?
Answer: Dental sealants have been shown to reduce the risk of molar decay by almost 80 percent. Children with sealants tend to have significantly fewer cavities compared to those without, making sealants a highly effective preventive treatment against tooth decay.
Question: What is Baby Bottle Tooth Decay?
Answer: Baby Bottle Tooth Decay, also known as Early Childhood Caries or Nursing Bottle Caries, is a condition where infants and toddlers experience tooth decay, particularly in the upper front teeth, often caused by prolonged exposure to sugary drinks and improper bottle use.
Question: What causes Baby Bottle Tooth Decay?
Answer: The primary causes of Baby Bottle Tooth Decay include continuous exposure to sugary drinks, using a bottle as a pacifier, and inadequate fluoride. Bacteria can also be transferred from a caregiverâ€™s saliva to the child through shared utensils or pacifiers.
Question: What are the signs of Baby Bottle Tooth Decay?
Answer: Signs include white spots on the gumline of the upper front teeth, which may indicate early decay. These signs can be difficult to detect without proper dental equipment.
Question: How can Baby Bottle Tooth Decay be prevented?
Answer: Prevention methods include wiping the baby's gums with a damp cloth after feeding, avoiding saliva sharing, using a grain of rice-sized amount of fluoride toothpaste for brushing baby teeth, and avoiding sugary drinks in bottles.
Question: What treatments are available for Baby Bottle Tooth Decay?
Answer: Treatments vary based on severity but may include fluoride treatments, silver diamine fluoride applications to remineralize enamel, pit-and-fissure sealants, and dietary recommendations. Severe cases might require stainless steel crowns or even tooth extraction.
Question: When should a baby first visit a dentist?
Answer: It is recommended to bring a baby to a pediatric dentist at six months old or when their first tooth starts to erupt, to establish a dental care plan and prevent early tooth decay.
Question: What are the potential consequences if Baby Bottle Tooth Decay is not treated?
Answer: Untreated decay can lead to pain, costly emergency dental care, damage to permanent teeth, infections, and misaligned teeth requiring extensive orthodontic treatment.
Question: Why is it important to treat Baby Bottle Tooth Decay?
Answer: Treating this condition is crucial because baby teeth act as placeholders for permanent teeth. Losing baby teeth prematurely can affect the spacing and alignment of permanent teeth, impacting overall oral health and requiring future orthodontic work.

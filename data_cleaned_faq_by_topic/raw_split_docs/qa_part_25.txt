Question: Is chewing bubble gum harmful for children's teeth?
Answer: Yes, bubble gum sweetened with sugar can be harmful as it promotes the production of enamel-eroding acids from bacteria in dental plaque. This type of gum can do more damage than candy as it stays in the mouth longer.
Question: What are the benefits of chewing gum for dental health?
Answer: Chewing gum, especially types that are sugar-free, can be beneficial for dental health as it stimulates saliva production. Saliva helps to wash away food particles, neutralize damaging acids, and can help prevent cavities.
Question: How can parents mitigate the harmful effects of sugary gum on their child's teeth?
Answer: Parents can mitigate the harmful effects by encouraging their child to brush or rinse their mouth after chewing sugary gum. Offering to trade sugary gum for gum sweetened with xylitol, which does not promote acid production by oral bacteria, is another effective strategy.
Question: Why is sugar-free gum recommended over sugary gum for children?
Answer: Sugar-free gum is recommended because it does not contain sugar that feeds bacteria in the mouth to produce harmful acids. Instead, it promotes increased saliva flow which helps prevent cavities without the risk of sugar-induced dental decay.
Question: What should parents do if their child frequently chews gum containing sugar?
Answer: Parents should educate their child about the risks of chewing sugary gum and encourage practices like brushing or rinsing after chewing. They should also consider providing alternatives such as sugar-free or xylitol-sweetened gum to protect their child's dental health.

Question: What is the purpose of wearing a Hawley retainer after braces?
Answer: The Hawley retainer helps stabilize teeth in their new position while the bone around them hardens, ensuring the teeth remain straight after braces are removed. It is a crucial final step in the orthodontic process.
Question: What are the key components of a Hawley retainer?
Answer: A Hawley retainer is made of plastic and metal, custom-molded to fit the mouth. It has wires that sit over the front six teeth and loops near the canines that can be adjusted as teeth reach their final positions.
Question: How often should a Hawley retainer be worn?
Answer: Initially, an orthodontist will recommend wearing the Hawley retainer for most of the day. The frequency can decrease over time as directed by your orthodontist based on how well the teeth have stabilized.

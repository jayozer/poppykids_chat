Question: What is velopharyngeal insufficiency?
Answer: Velopharyngeal insufficiency is a condition where insufficient tissue in the velum (soft part of the roof of the mouth) or pharynx (throat) fails to close off the nasal passage during speech, allowing air to escape through the nose and affecting speech sound production.
Question: What are the main causes of velopharyngeal insufficiency?
Answer: The primary causes of velopharyngeal insufficiency include cleft palates, complications from adenoidectomy, velocardiofacial syndrome, and in some cases, the cause is unknown.
Question: How is velopharyngeal insufficiency diagnosed?
Answer: Diagnosis typically involves a referral to a speech pathologist who may use nasendoscopy to observe the movement of the child's palate while speaking to confirm the presence of velopharyngeal insufficiency.
Question: What are the treatment options for velopharyngeal insufficiency?
Answer: Treatment options vary based on the severity and can include speech therapy, Furlow palatoplasty, sphincter pharyngoplasty, pharyngeal flap surgery, or posterior pharyngeal wall injection augmentation to improve the closure of the nasal passage during speech.

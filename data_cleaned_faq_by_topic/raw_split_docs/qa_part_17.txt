Question: What can be done to protect the space if a natal tooth falls out early?
Answer: A space maintainer can be used to reserve the gap left by a fallen natal tooth. This device helps prevent other teeth from moving into the space, ensuring there is room for permanent teeth to erupt properly.
Question: When can orthodontic intervention begin if a child has crooked or crowded permanent teeth due to early loss of natal teeth?

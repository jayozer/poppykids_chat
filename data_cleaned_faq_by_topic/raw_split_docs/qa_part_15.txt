Question: What are the risks associated with an unsanitary baby bottle?
Answer: Risks include exposure to bacteria leading to tooth decay, stomach bugs like rotavirus, and severe infections from Cronobacter, which can cause sepsis. These are particularly dangerous for infants under 6 months who have weaker immune systems.
Question: At what age is sterilizing baby bottles most crucial?
Answer: Sterilizing baby bottles is most crucial for infants under 6 months, as recommended by health authorities, because their immune systems are still developing and they are more susceptible to infections.

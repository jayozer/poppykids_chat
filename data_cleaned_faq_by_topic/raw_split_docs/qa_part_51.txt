Question: What is the extrusion reflex in infants?
Answer: The extrusion reflex, also known as the tongue-thrust reflex, is a natural response in which a baby pushes solid food out of their mouth using their tongue. This reflex is a protective instinct to prevent choking and ensure that only breast milk or formula is swallowed during the early months.
Question: At what age is it generally recommended to start introducing solid foods to a baby?
Answer: The CDC recommends waiting until a baby is at least six months old before introducing solid foods as part of their diet.
Question: How can you tell if your baby is not ready for solid foods?
Answer: One way to check if your baby is ready for solid foods is to observe if they still exhibit the extrusion reflex. Place your finger on your baby’s lips and see if they push it with their tongue. If they do, it may indicate that the reflex is still active and they might not be ready for solids.
Question: Why might a baby continue to push food out of their mouth even after being introduced to solids?
Answer: If a baby continues to push food out of their mouth, it doesn't necessarily mean they dislike the food. Rather, it may indicate that their extrusion reflex is still present. This reflex diminishes gradually as the baby gets older and more ready to handle solid foods.
Question: What should parents do if their baby is not yet ready to eat solid foods?
Answer: If a baby is not ready for solid foods, parents should wait a few more days and try again later. Continued presence of the extrusion reflex means the baby is still developing the ability to eat solids safely.
Question: How should parents care for their baby’s oral health when starting solids?
Answer: Parents should establish a regular oral care routine as they introduce solids. This can include using a piece of gauze to rub the baby's gums or a gentle infant toothbrush to brush away food particles, ensuring the baby's mouth stays clean even before teeth appear.

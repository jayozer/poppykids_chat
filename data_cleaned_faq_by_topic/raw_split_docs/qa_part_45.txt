Question: What causes gingivitis in children?
Answer: Gingivitis in children is primarily caused by the buildup of plaque along the gumline and between the teeth. If plaque is not removed, it hardens into tartar, which irritates the gums and leads to symptoms like bleeding and swelling.
Question: What are the signs of gingivitis in children?
Answer: Signs of gingivitis in children include swelling, redness, and bleeding around the teeth and gums, especially after brushing or flossing. Children might also experience soreness and sensitivity in their gums.
Question: How can parents help prevent gingivitis in their children?
Answer: Parents can prevent gingivitis by ensuring their children brush their teeth twice daily with fluoride toothpaste, use a soft-bristled toothbrush, and clean between their teeth with floss or an interdental cleaner. Regular dental check-ups and cleanings are also crucial.
Question: At what age should children start flossing?
Answer: Children should start flossing once they have two teeth that touch, typically around the age of two or three. By the age of ten, children should be able to floss independently.
Question: How often should children have professional dental cleanings?
Answer: Children should visit the dentist for professional cleanings every six months. These cleanings involve removing plaque and tartar with specialized tools and polishing the teeth.

Question: How can mouth breathing affect a child's gum health?
Answer: Mouth breathing can lead to dry mouth, which exacerbates gum bleeding and gingivitis because it reduces saliva that normally helps control bacteria growth. Parents should consult with a pediatrician if their child habitually breathes through their mouth.

Question: What are the potential effects of untreated tongue thrust in children?
Answer: If untreated, tongue thrust can lead to speech problems, difficulties in chewing, displaced teeth requiring orthodontic treatment, and improper resting position of the tongue.
Question: At what age should treatment for tongue thrust begin, and what does it involve?
Answer: Treatment typically starts at the age of eight and involves customized activities and exercises guided by a speech therapist to correct the way the mouth rests and how saliva, liquids, and solids are swallowed. Treatment duration is around three to five months with follow-up appointments.
Question: When should a parent consult a professional about their childâ€™s tongue thrust?
Answer: Parents should consult a dental professional or pediatrician if they observe symptoms like the tongue resting in the wrong position, prolonged sucking habits, open resting lips, or difficulty chewing in their older baby or toddler.
Question: How does baby tongue thrust naturally resolve?
Answer: Baby tongue thrust usually resolves as the child starts eating solid foods around four to six months of age, as they develop the coordination to move food from the front to the back of the mouth for swallowing.
Question: What general dental care should be continued for a baby with tongue thrust?
Answer: Regular dental health care, including cleaning the teeth with toothpaste specially formulated for infants as soon as they erupt, should continue normally to ensure dental health regardless of tongue thrust.
Question: How does stress in children potentially affect their oral health?
Answer: Stress in children can lead to unhealthy behaviors like overeating or consuming sugary foods, neglecting proper oral hygiene practices such as brushing and flossing, and can increase the risk of infections and teeth grinding. This can exacerbate oral health issues and potentially lead to TMJ disorders.
Question: What are common triggers of stress in children?
Answer: Common stress triggers in children include everyday activities, responsibilities at school, dynamics at home, and expectations from various aspects of their lives.
Question: How is stress in children diagnosed or measured?

Question: What can parents do to help manage their child's stress and its effects on oral health?
Answer: Parents can help by identifying and reducing stress triggers, modeling healthy behaviors, ensuring proper oral hygiene, maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, discussing stress openly with their child, and seeking professional advice from counselors or medical professionals for stress management.
Question: Why is dental care particularly important for children experiencing stress?
Answer: Stress can negatively influence a child's oral health by promoting unhealthy eating habits, reducing the likelihood of maintaining good dental hygiene, and increasing the risk of oral infections and teeth grinding. Proper dental care helps mitigate these risks.
Question: What role does a child's immune response and saliva production play in stress-related oral health issues?
Answer: Stress can decrease a child's immune response and slow down saliva production, which is essential for neutralizing acids in the mouth. This reduction can lead to an increased risk of oral health problems.
Question: Is a tongue cleaner necessary for a newborn baby's oral care?
Answer: A separate baby tongue cleaner is not necessary for a newborn's oral care. Instead, you can use a piece of gauze or a washcloth soaked in water to gently wipe the baby's tongue, gums, and teeth (once they erupt) to get them accustomed to dental hygiene practices.
Question: How should I clean my baby's mouth before their teeth come in?
Answer: Before your baby's teeth come in, use a small piece of gauze or a washcloth dampened with water to clean their mouth. Wrap the gauze around your finger, hold your baby comfortably, and gently wipe inside their mouth to remove any food particles or milk residue.
Question: What changes in oral care are needed after my baby's teeth start to erupt?
Answer: Once your baby's teeth begin to erupt, typically between four to six months, you should start using a soft, kid-friendly toothbrush designed for small mouths. Continue using damp gauze to clean their gums and tongue, and introduce a toothbrush for the visible teeth.
Question: When can I start using toothpaste for my baby, and how much should I use?
Answer: You can start using a small amount of toothpaste, about the size of a grain of rice, when your baby's first tooth appears. This is recommended until they reach the age of three, after which you can increase the amount to the size of a pea. Always consult your pediatric dentist for personalized advice.

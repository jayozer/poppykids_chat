Q: What are the differences between orthodontic and non-orthodontic pacifiers?
A: Orthodontic pacifiers have a flatter and squarer shape designed to mimic the mother's nipple during nursing and accommodate the baby's tongue movement naturally. Non-orthodontic pacifiers have a rounded, bulb-like shape.

Q: What are the potential benefits of using an orthodontic pacifier?
A: Orthodontic pacifiers may reduce the risk of malocclusion (bite issues) in babies and are less likely to encourage poor oral health habits such as thumb-sucking if introduced before the age of 3 months.
Q: What is Bisphenol A (BPA) and why is it a concern in dental sealants?
A: Bisphenol A (BPA) is a chemical used in making various plastics and resins, including some dental materials like sealants. Concerns arise because BPA can potentially seep into the body, possibly affecting brain function and behavior in children, as well as increasing blood pressure.

Q: How much BPA is released from dental sealants and is it safe?
A: Studies show that dental sealants release about 0.09 nanograms of BPA, which is significantly lower than the safety threshold of 1 million nanograms per day proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency for a 6-year-old child. The American Dental Association considers this amount safe.

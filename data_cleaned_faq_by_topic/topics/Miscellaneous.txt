Q: Are there any health risks associated with using pacifiers or thumb-sucking?
A: Both pacifiers and thumb-sucking carry some risks. Using a pacifier slightly increases the risk of ear infections in young children. Thumb-sucking beyond the age of 4 can lead to dental problems.
Q: What causes Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD)?
A: HFMD is caused by different strains of the Coxsackievirus, with Coxsackievirus A16 being one of the common causes in the United States.

Q: How is HFMD transmitted among children?
A: HFMD is transmitted through direct contact with saliva, stool, liquid from blisters, or respiratory droplets from a cough or sneeze.

Q: How long does it typically take for a child to recover from HFMD?
A: Most children recover from HFMD in less than two weeks, but recovery times can vary depending on the severity of the symptoms.

Q: Is HFMD contagious even if the infected person shows no symptoms?
A: Yes, HFMD can be contagious even if the infected person is asymptomatic, which makes controlling its spread challenging in communal settings like daycares.

Q: How does HFMD differ from Herpangina?
A: While both are caused by similar viruses and have similar initial symptoms like fever and sore throat, Herpangina primarily results in blisters at the back of the mouth and usually affects children aged three to ten, resolving within three to five days.

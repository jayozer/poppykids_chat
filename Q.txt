Q: When do babies start to teethe?
A: Teething usually occurs around 6 months of age. Typically, the two front bottom teeth (lower central incisors) are the first to erupt, followed by the two front top teeth (upper central incisors).

Q: What are the signs and symptoms of teething?
A: Signs and symptoms of teething include irritability, trouble sleeping, fussiness, loss of appetite, drooling more than usual, and a desire to chew on hard objects. Symptoms usually begin about 3 to 5 days before a tooth erupts, and they disappear as soon as the tooth breaks through the gums.

Q: How can I help soothe my baby's teething pain?
A: You can soothe sore gums by rubbing them gently with a clean finger, a small cool spoon, or a moist gauze pad. A clean teething ring or pacifier can also help. Avoid teething rings with liquid inside as they may break or leak. If your child is especially cranky, ask your pediatrician or pediatric dentist if it is okay to give a weight-appropriate dose of acetaminophen.
